# Depression Dynamics with Social Support Model

## Overview

This project simulates depression dynamics within a population using an agent-based model. The model includes individuals with varying depression levels and supportive members providing different levels of support. The goal is to study how social support affects depression levels over time.

## Structure

The project contains the following files:

model.py: Defines the agent-based model, including agent behavior and interactions.
run.py: Contains the script to run simulations of the model.
server.py: Sets up the server to visualize the model using the Mesa framework.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need Python 3 and the following packages:

mesa: Agent-based modeling framework
networkx: Network analysis package
numpy: Numerical computations
random: Random number generation

## Usage

To run the model, execute the following command:
```
python run.py
```
